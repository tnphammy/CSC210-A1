Reflection on your experience with this assignment: This instructions were worded more clearly than A0, which helped a lot, but this is quite a big assignment in my opinion :<. I think the expectations of each method group could've been more clearly worded (modify in-place, create new...) -- there are absolutely indications of that, but it was not fully clear.
